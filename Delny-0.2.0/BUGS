Known issues
============

* Some sets might fail to triangulate.  For example the square from
  the delaunay/test/test_qhull.py script.  Problems can only occur
  when having non-simplical facets (but don't have to), so normally
  everything will work.  With a bit of luck this problem might get
  solved reasonable soon.
