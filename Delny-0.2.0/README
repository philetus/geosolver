Delny
=====

This package contains some Python modules for Delaunay triangulation
using the Qhull C library libqhull.


Prerequisites
=============

Before the installation you will need an installation of qhull 2003.1
including it's header files and libqhull in the standard locations for
your system.  The _qhull module is an extension module and needs this
to compile.

Next the Numeric module for Python should be available, also including
it's development files in the standard locations.

And of course a proper Python installation with the header files and
other development files.

For Debian and Ubuntu these are the packages you want, some may
depend on each other:
python
python-dev
python-numeric
libqhull5
libqhull-dev


Installation
============

Delny uses the Distutils, so to install run

  $ ./setup install

from within Delny's root directory.

Or to install in your home directory for example, make sure
~/lib/pyton exists and is included in your Python path (by setting the
PYTHONPATH environment variable for instance) and run:

  $ ./setup install --home=~

For more information on the installation (recommended!) using
Distutils use:

  $ ./setup --help

Extensive online Distutils documentation for sysadmins can be found on
http://www.python.org/inst/inst.html


Testing the installation
========================

Tests are included under the subdirectory `test'.  Files testing an
individual module name "module" will be called "test_module", to test
all modules at once there is a convenience script `all.py'.  If you
want to run them make sure the correct `delaunay' package will get
imported (see NOTE under "Using Delny" below), so to test a recent
build e.g.:

  $ ./setup build
  $ cd build/lib.linux-i686-2.3  # or whichever dir for your setup
  $ ../../test/all.py

If tests fail be sure to check the `BUGS' file to see if there is any
information about them.


Using Delny
===========

Once installed, information on how to use is available from within
Python as:

  import delaunay
  help(delaunay)

NOTE: when the current directory is the package root the Python
interpreter will import the Delaunay package form there instead as
from the installed location because it comes first in sys.path.  This
results in an error as __init__.py tries to load the _qhull module
which is not available there as it is provided by _qhull.so which is
only in the build/ directory and in it's installed directory.  Make
sure you are using the package with the compiled extension module.


Upgrading from pre 0.2.0
========================

No incompatible API changes where made.  Only the
delaunay.facets_indices() method has been added.  Most changes where
internally inside the _qhull module which is now much cleaner and more
flexible.

Note that there is still no guaranteed API stability as long as 1.0 is
not reached.  In fact changes are still planned.

The new versioning sheme doesn't use the `a' or `b' suffixes anymore
for alpha or beta.  Just now that there's no stability untill 1.0 is
reached.  The alpha and beta releases may come back when 1.0 is
reached or just before.


Upgrading from pre 0.1.0a2
==========================

Please note the API changes, this is still alpha so you should have
know this would happen.

Basically: (i) the package name is changed to "delaunay" (formerly
"Delaunay").  (ii) the format for method (and function) names has
changed.  Wat formally was "get_this_stuff()" is now "getThisStuff()".
(iii) the tests have moved to the directory which they are testing,
that is "Delny-xxx/tests/*" has moved to "Delny-xxx/delaunay/tests/*"

As always, hopefully these things won't change anymore...


Using qhull3.1
==============

When using qhull3.1 it will be necessary to modify the
delaunay/_qhullmodule.c file.  Near the top you will see a line where
#define QHULL_31_COMP=1 is commented out, uncomment this and it should
work for qhull3.1.
A more automated way for this is envisioned for a future release.

Please note that any earlier version of qhull does not support
triangulated output (Qt) and thus will not normally work with Delny,
qhull3.1 is the oldest version you can use.
